# AFModulus_Flex
A Biophysics Flex : Calculating Modulus from AFM data (Atomic force microscopy). 


#Research questions

dataframe used : barcode 4069

1. What is transformation of Z to t and vice versa (Selen)
output : table conversion 
2. What is the starting point (touching point) (Astrid and Audrey)
	- output : from t vs F table, use conversion factor from (1)
	- fitting (linear interpolation) 
3. What is the maximum point (what is the middleâ€™s (x and y) 95% CI, is x always at 128 as time index ) (Selen)
	- output : from t vs F table, use conversion factor from (1), y val, x val = index (time stamp)
	- fitting and histogram

11h next meeting 15.01.2020


next goals Tuesday 19.01.2020, 10h meet, Audrey's zoom:

YM formula (Selene)
Topography (python Astrid and Selen) create image
Intergrate my code and for loop (Audrey) 
Tell Selene contact point and max point. 

next meeting 20.01.2020, 13h30h meet, Audrey's zoom.

next next to do list, Selen, Astrid, Audrey :
Quantify precision and accuracy in intersection
Quantify precision and accuracy in YM
Define background and study aims, including variables :
Contact point
