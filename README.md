# AFModulus_Flex
A Biophysics Flex : Calculating Modulus from AFM data (Atomic force microscopy). 


#Research questions

dataframe used : barcode 4069

1. What is transformation of Z to t and vice versa (Selen)
output : table conversion 
2. What is the starting point (touching point) (Astrid and Audrey)
	- output : from t vs F table, use conversion factor from (1)
	- fitting (linear interpolation) 
3. What is the maximum point (what is the middleâ€™s (x and y) 95% CI, is x always at 128 as time index ) (Selen)
	- output : from t vs F table, use conversion factor from (1), y val, x val = index (time stamp)
	- fitting and histogram
